//! Implementation of [yamux](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/blob/master/spec.md), a multiplexer
//! over reliable, ordered connections, such as TCP/IP.
//!
//! The two primary objects, clients of this crate interact with, are `Connection` and
//! `StreamHandle`. The former wraps the underlying connection and multiplexes `StreamHandle`s
//! which implement `tokio_io::AsyncRead` and `tokio_io::AsyncWrite` over it.
//! `Connection` implements `futures::Stream` yielding `StreamHandle`s for inbound connection
//! attempts.
